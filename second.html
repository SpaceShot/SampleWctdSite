    <h1>My page about hockey</h1>
  </div>
  <p>I started playing hockey when I was in high school. I did not start on ice, but on roller blades. Later I learned
    to ice skate and played ice hockey.</p>
  <p>If you really want to get better as a hockey player, the
    most fundamental skill is skating.</p>
  <p>Here is what you need to play:</p>
  <ul class="italic-text">
    <li>ice skates</li>
    <li>hockey stick</li>
    <li>puck</li>
    <li>helmet</li>
    <li>net</li>
  </ul>
